              The report will include only the products that are part of the selected services/components and the requirements
              linked to them, the data linked to those requirements and the data providers linked to the filtered data.
              Please also note that the deleted entries are also considered in this filtering (to include the "delete" action),
              so an object might be included in the report even if its link was deleted.
